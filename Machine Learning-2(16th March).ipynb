    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is trained too well on the training data, to the point that it becomes too specific to that data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance on both training and new data. Overfitting can be mitigated by using regularization techniques, increasing the amount of training data, or simplifying the model, while underfitting can be addressed by increasing the model's complexity or adding more features to the data."

    "Overfitting in machine learning can be reduced by various techniques such as regularization, increasing the size of the dataset, or simplifying the model. Regularization methods like L1 or L2 regularization can be used to penalize the model for using too many features or for large parameter values, preventing it from becoming too specific to the training data. Increasing the size of the dataset can help the model generalize better, while simplifying the model, such as reducing the number of layers or neurons in a neural network, can also reduce overfitting. Cross-validation can also be used to evaluate the model's performance on new data."
